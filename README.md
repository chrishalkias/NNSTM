Here are some jupyter notebooks used for one of my research projects titled "Statistical mechanics of deep learning". The notebooks consist of
simple computations of partition functions and a regression based classifiaction attempt of the `MNIST` dtaset to be compared with analytical (approximate)
results from statistical mechanical methods.
